I'm Dan, a Software Engineer from [Colchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchester) in the UK. My experience ranges through design, development and maintenance of web applications for startups, SMEs, public sector, FTSE 100 and Fortune 500 organisations. Experienced with greenfield projects and legacy systems, in both a microservice and monolith setup.

I've worked mostly with technologies including Go, PHP (Symfony and Laravel), JavaScript, MySQL, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Docker and Kubernetes.

Like to get touch? Great! Here are my [contact details](/contact).
