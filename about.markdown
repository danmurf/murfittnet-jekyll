![Dan](/assets/images/Dan.jpg){:style="float: right;margin-left: 10px;"}Hey, I'm Dan, and I'm a software engineer from [Colchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchester) in the UK. My experience ranges through design, development and maintenance of web applications for startups, SMEs, public sector, FTSE 100 and Fortune 500 organisations. Experienced with greenfield projects, legacy systems, CMSs, MVC frameworks, and non-framework applications.

I've worked mostly with technologies including PHP (Symfony and Laravel), Go, JavaScript, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Docker and Vagrant.

Like to get touch? Great! Here are my [contact details](/contact).
