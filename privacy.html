<p>This is just a personal blog. I use a few tools to run the website, and I've listed them below.</p>

<h3>Jekyll and Github</h3>

<p>This website is built using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. In non-technical terms, this is a pretty simple setup which doesn't require any database or backend, user login, etc. - it just serves a simple HTML webpage which you're reading right now. Github kindly host these types of site for free (since they are just HTML files). That being said, they may collect some information in the background for the purposes of security and to maintain their service. Here's a link to their privacy policy if you'd like to read more: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">Github Privacy Policy</a></p>

<p>I hope this has made things clear. If you have any questions please email me by visiting the contact page on this website (<a href="http://murfitt.net/contact">http://murfitt.net/contact</a>).
