The book covers a range of techniques for customising the header, footer, store navigation, creating dynamic content, custom error pages and sitemaps. The author, Tahsin Hasan, is a fellow CodeIgniter developer and has worked with other PHP frameworks such as Zend, Symfony and CakePHP.

Iâ€™ll be posting the review in the next few weeks. In the meantime, here is a link to a sample chapter: [Chapter 3 - Layout Structure](http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/4309OS-Chapter-3-Layout-Structure.pdf?utm_source=packtpub&utm_medium=free&utm_campaign=pdf).
