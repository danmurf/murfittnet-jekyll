I've just installed the Drupal Editor app for Android and this is my first 'test post' if you will. It's quite a simple app that connects to your Drupal site through the core blog api module. It then shows a list of all Drupal blogs and allows you to view, edit or delete the posts. You can also post new entries and assign taxonomy terms to them. It's simple and gets the job done!

To install this app search for 'Drupal Editor' on the Android Market. Enjoy!
