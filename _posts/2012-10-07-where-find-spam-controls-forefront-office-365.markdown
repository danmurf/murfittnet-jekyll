Things have been ticking over nicely since Microsoft updated its Exchange Online services to Office 365. The other day I needed to find the spam controls (Forefront) and they weren't where I was expecting them to be so I thought I'd post the details here in case anyone else is having trouble finding them. You'll need to be logged in as an Office 365 admin:

1. Login to the Office 365 Portal
2. Click 'Admin overview' on the left
3. Click 'manage' under 'Exchange'
4. Click 'mail control' on the left
5. Click the 'configure' link on the right under 'Forefront Online Protection for Exchange'

That's it. Hope this helps :)
