The recent TechCrunch disrupt award [saw startup Qwiki](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/qwiki-techcrunch-disrupt-winner/) win disruptive product for their information experience website which seeks to change the way we consume information. This is the kind of thing which we've seen in movies for years but Qwiki is making this experience a reality by pulling together information from various sources and presenting it in a much more experiential way. This sort of delivery is probably well suited to that kind of research where you hear a term you haven't heard before and you want to know more. You'll probably start by typing the term into Google then sift through the (usually first result) Wikipedia page followed by image search and/or movies etc. What Qwiki does is pull all of this together for you so you get an instant overview of all the information in a much more 'lean back' way.

The video below is a demo of the product at TechCrunch Disrupt 2010. If you'd like to sign up for their invite-only alpha test head over to [Qwiki.com](http://qwiki.com/). They also have a few sample Qwikis live on the site.
