I'll be posting another CodeIgniter book review for Packt Publishing shortly: '[CodeIgniter 1.7 Professional Development' by Adam Griffiths](http://www.packtpub.com/codeigniter-1-7-professional-development/book/mid/0405109at6rt?utm_source=murfitt.net&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_003216).

I'm really looking forward to reading this book, in particular the chapter on user authentication through Twitter and Facebook Connect.
