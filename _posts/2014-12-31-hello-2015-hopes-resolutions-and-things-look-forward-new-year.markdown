For those of you that know me, you'll know that I'd have a lot to say about 2014. It's been a strange year. I won't go into it in this blog post, but instead I'm going to look forward and welcome 2015 with wide eyes and big open arms. Come in and make yourself at home, 2015! So, here are a few things I'd like to look forward to in the new year.

##Get out more

I always feel better when I get out, meet new people, learn new things. And I need to do more of it. Specifically, I'd like to:

*   go to more meet-ups
*   go to more conferences
*   generally meet more people

##Record more. Reflect more.

I saw a video blog recently (sorry, I can't remember the link, hence this point really...) about how keeping a diary or journal can help with learning and general memory retention. It seems it's good for your memory if you reflect upon things after (as well as keeping a written record, of course). I've read some great books, and seen some great films, but they kind of get 'put in the pile' in my mind. I'd actually like more of a record, and I'd like to be able to look back at the end of next year and know exactly what I've done to help me reflect upon the smaller good points, the ones that <strike>sometimes</strike> always get forgotten. So here's what I propose to my 2015 self:

*   Keep a journal every day. Even if it's short. Even if it seems pointless at the time. Write it down.
*   Blog more. I actually enjoy writing so why don't I do it more? Write a blog post at least once a week. Either on here or somewhere else (Medium, LinkedIn Pulse, etc,)

##Build my first Raspberry Pi project

I was very kindly bought a Raspberry Pi for Christmas by my father in law. I love how there are so many possibilities packed into something so small. I've wanted to have a play with one for a while, so now I've got one I'd like to use it properly and build it into something useful in a project.

##Launch Skilful.co

I've been working on a new business for online management training - teaching skills like how to run meetings, interview, build great teams, etc. We're planning on launching early 2015, and there's still a lot to do, but we're all really looking forward to getting it online. 

##Make more videos and take more pictures

I've been on Instagram since, well, I can't remember but it was before it was popular (hipster achievement unlocked), but I've only recently started getting into it. Daniel Kahneman said that many people are "experiencing the present as an anticipated memory". This still fascinates me, and I love taking pictures with it - making something simple look artistic and reflective.

I've also toyed with the idea of keeping a video blog. The hardest thing about starting this isn't getting the kit, or even finding the time, it's finding something interesting to talk about. I'm sure we all have interesting things to talk about, right? So then it's about *recognising* something interesting to talk about. So:

*   Try and take a picture once a day. Even if it seems pointless.
*   Publish an online video review of something
*   Publish an online video tutorial. Teach something on YouTube.

So there you have it. Now I'm going to head out, see some friends, and welcome in the new year with a couple of glasses of wine. :) Thanks for dropping by and hope you have a great 2015!

Dan
