Packt Publishing were kind enough to ask me if I'd like to review one of their latest OpenCart books: '[Instant E-commerce with OpenCart: Build a Shop [Instant]](http://www.packtpub.com/ecommerce-with-opencart/book)' by Murat Yilmaz. It'll be the first time I've read a book in their 'Instant' series, as I've reviewed a couple of their regular books before, so I'll be interested to see how it compares. Check back soon for my full review.
