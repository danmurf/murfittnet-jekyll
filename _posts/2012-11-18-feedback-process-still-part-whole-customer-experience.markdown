<img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3531/4555108439_c3aba7565b_m.jpg" width="240" height="142" alt="questions" style="float:right; margin:15px;">It seems every interaction I have with a company these days is followed by a "how did we do?" survey. It's not like we step aside and forget the company when we're going through the questionnaire - it's still part of the experience. Imagine if this was true for high street shopping, and after every purchase, no matter how large or small, we were being chased out of the shop by someone begging for feedback.

Metrics are valuable and many companies make big decisions based on what they know people like and dislike (and somewhat like and somewhat dislike...), but please don't forget that you are asking someone for their time and effort, so use it sparingly. The way [Vocalabs put this](http://www.vocalabs.com/blog/too-many-surveys) is "is it possible to ask someone for too many favors?". Sadly, it probably is.
