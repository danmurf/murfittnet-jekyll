My dad came over today to help sort our garden out. We wanted to open the end of the garden up to grow some colourful plants and maybe add a few solar lights. The end of the garden was previously segmented into smaller pieces, with a raised patch with a few shrubs and some fenced off stones.

Here you can see we started to knock the wall down before but had to put it off for a while as the foundation of the wall went quite deep. Quite satisfying work, knocking a wall down!

Once we broke into the wall foundations we managed to pull large chunks of the wall up without any problems. All that's left to do is tidy up!

Here's the finished result - a nice patch of soil ready for a few layers of colourful plants and some solar lights.
