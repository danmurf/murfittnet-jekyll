The Drupal Zen sub-theme, Zen Classic, [is to no longer be included](http://drupal.org/node/628480) with the Zen theme download. The Zen theme [will now purely be a theme framework and starter kit](http://drupal.org/node/426750). If the Zen Classic theme is to be continued it may be done so as a separate project. Although many people said it was bland I quite liked the simplicity of it, but since it's been removed and I've been thinking of redesigning my site anyway maybe this was the kick up the butt I needed to put pencil to paper!

In terms of Zen sub-themes there are a few available to download from the Drupal website: [http://drupal.org/node/340837](http://drupal.org/node/340837)

There's also a list of sites implementing Zen over at: [http://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/5171](http://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/5171)
