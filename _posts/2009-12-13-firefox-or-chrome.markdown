<a title="Chrome VS Firefox by Zohaib Usman, on Flickr" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23018251@N04/3372810526/"><img width="428" height="115" style="float:right" alt="Chrome VS Firefox" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/3372810526_35e8e2a353.jpg"></a>Here's an edgy stand-off I find myself in the middle of every so often – Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as my default browser. From a day to day, quick browse, everything is on the web perspective I'd have to say I prefer Google Chrome. It's fast(er), simple and gets the job done. However, from a web developer perspective Firefox has the add-ons that you so sorely need. I've tried designing a Drupal Zen sub-theme with Chrome's 'inspect element' feature but it's not as comprehensive as the Firebug add-on for Firefox which I couldn't work without. However, when I want to check my daily barrage of social sites Chrome shaves off valuable seconds. For today, I'll leave Firefox as my default browser simply because of the add-ons – they're useful, I need them and I don't mind sacrificing a bit of speed.
