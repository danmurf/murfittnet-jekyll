No idea what this means, but I thought I'd post it in case anyone else was having the same problem - don't you just love spurious error codes?

I was trying for a while to sign on to MSN messenger but I kept getting error code 80048834 (ohhhh...that one....). After some help from Google I came across a forum post where a couple of people were having the same issue. Anyway, for people skimming this post I'll jump straight to the solution...

Fix

Go to [http://login.live.com](http://login.live.com), login, accept their terms, then try again. I did this and I was taken to "Page not found" at [http://storage.msn.com](http://storage.msn.com) (which I still can't access), but at least I can now login. There was a post on the Microsoft Communities website maybe shedding some more light on the issue - it seems it could be something to do with the time on your PC being incorrect.
