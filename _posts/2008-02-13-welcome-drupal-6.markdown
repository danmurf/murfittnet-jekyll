Drupal 6 [was released](http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0) today! After having a play with the beta and release candidates...well, I don't have to say; this really is a phenomenal release! Here are some of my favourite new features which I'm looking forward to using:

* **Extended logging** - You can set Drupal for OS level logging
* **Batch API** - A progress bar can track tasks running in the background through multiple HTTP requests
* **Scripting from the command line** - This is really cool! You can now run Drupal code through the command line
* **Forum improvements** - Granular permissions can allow more control over forum moderation
* **Sticky table headers** - Does what it says on the tin
* **Drag and drop features** - Again, the tin...
* **CSS only theming** - Define regions etc. in .info files without writing any php code, then set styles in CSS

Well done to everyone who has been clearly working hard on this!
