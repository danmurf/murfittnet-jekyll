Well, it's now April and many T-Mobile G2 Touch owners are waiting for the Android 2.1 update for their handsets, although all is still quiet on the news front. The last [update from T-Mobile](http://support.t-mobile.co.uk/discussions/index?page=forums&topic=801038071f0699e0126d76e2ac5007f9f) I saw was back in February when T-Mobile announced that they will be releasing "a firmware upgrade in April for the T-Mobile G2 Touch". We're all hoping that this will indeed be the Android 2.1 Eclair update we've been waiting for. There are [some rumours out there](http://www.htcheroblog.com/2010/03/27/latest-rumour-mill-on-htc-hero-eclair-update/) as to the exact date and content of this release, but none of these are confirmed, so all we can do is play the waiting game for now.

I'll be checking the[ Android Updates](http://support.t-mobile.co.uk/help-and-support/index?page=home&cat=SOFTWAREDOWNLOADS) section on the T-Mobile website throughout the month to see if anything appears, Eclair or otherwise.
