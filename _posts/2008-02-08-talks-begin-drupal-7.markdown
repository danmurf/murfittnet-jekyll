It's incredible how rapid the development of Drupal has become. Drupal 6 is [only just around the corner](http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0-rc3) and we're already [talking about](http://drupal.org/node/217702) what improvements and features we'd like to see in Drupal 7! Drupal 5 has been absolutely fantastic. I've found it not only a great content management system, but also an excellent framework for building applications.

Anyone who wishes to officially request a new feature for Drupal 7 [may do so on the Drupal website](http://drupal.org/project/issues?projects=3060&categories=feature) by submitting a new issue. Some things I'd like to see would be:

* **Some kind of media management system** - not just for images, video and audio but maybe also PDFs and other attachable or embedded content
* **More core forum features**
* **Built in WYSIWYG editor**as I almost always use TinyMCE, which is great, but it would be nice not to have to install and upgrade it separately from the core
* **Improved node access control system**
* **Automatic upgrade** of core system and modules
* **Site backup** for both files and database
