Hello from Symfony 4! Today I finished the move from Laravel to Symfony 4. The content and design hasn't moved, but the entire backend has been rewritten using Symfony 4. 

I've managed to keep the content online for well over 10 years, and it's been running on various versions of Drupal (5, 6, and 7) after being completely rewritten and migrated to Laravel a couple of years ago. A few months ago, I decided to rewrite it _again_, this time in Symfony. I saw a demo of Flex at Symfony Live last year, and I thought it looked like a lot of fun to work with. And it is :)
